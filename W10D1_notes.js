    API Framework

Steps to start with Express
    1. Initialize node
        npm init -y
    2. Install packages
        Express - npm install express
        Nodemon - npm install -D nodemon
            The -D flag tells node to install the package as a dev dependency
    3. Create an app.js file - Main hub of our application
        Import express
        Use Express to instantiate app object
        Listen to a port (start the server)
